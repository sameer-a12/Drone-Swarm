# Drone Swarm Simulation

A simple drone swarm simulation made with Python and Pygame. It shows how multiple drones can move together like a real swarm by following basic rules.

## Features

- Simulates multiple drones moving together.
- Basic swarm behaviors:
  - Alignment: Drones match direction with neighbors.
  - Cohesion: Drones move closer to the group.
  - Separation: Drones avoid crashing into each other.
- Easy to run and modify.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
